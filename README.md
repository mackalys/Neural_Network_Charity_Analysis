# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to help the Alphabet Soup business team determine which charities to donate to by creating a nerual network. The neural network will help us to determine which of the organizations were successfully funded by Alphabet Soup rather the money going to something other than a charity.

## Results
### Data Processing
The variable that was considered the target for the model was the IS_SUCESSFUL variable as it represented which charity was successfully funded. All of the variables beside the EIN and NAME are the features for the model. I removed the EIN and NAME variable because they do not offer any significant data and did not help the model in any way.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
